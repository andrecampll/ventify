# Ventify ðŸŽ¹
Ventify ("Venturus + Spotify") is your new music management tool. It's a web app that allows you to manage your music library, create playlists, and share them with your friends. It's built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Curious? Check out the [live demo](https://ventify-khaki.vercel.app/)!

## Getting Started

First, add your .env.local file using the .env.local.example as a template.

To get the `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAST_FM_API_KEY` you'll need to check the [Last.fm API documentation](https://www.last.fm/api/) and generate a new API key.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
